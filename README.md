An AI camera system that provides secure, real-time video feeds from select cameras to the general public
via a website, offering insights into the traffic scenario of a particular locality. By employing AI algorithms,
the system is able to predict bus arrival times and optimize routes to minimize congestion, resulting in a
more efficient and effective public transportation system.
Moreover, the system uses blockchain technology to secure video footage of accidents, traffic law
violations, and other critical events, making it tamper-proof even for those in positions of power. The
decentralized nature of blockchain ensures that the data cannot be altered or manipulated by anyone,
providing a high level of trust and transparency to the public.
